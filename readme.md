<h1> Abstract </h1>
<p>We analyze the interactions in traditional Web2 markets (using real estate as example) and identify opportunities to optimize it using Web3 concepts and techniques. </p>
<p>
Web3 is often seen as a catch-all term that refers to the next version of the internet which incorporates concepts such as decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics. </p>
<p>
If there is one superpower in Web3, it is its ability to seamlessly coordinate across thousands of people and hundreds of organizations to work together in a trusted and transparent way. And when we all do, we can create new money such as Bitcoin, from scratch. We can create a trusted world computer and Smart Contract platforms like Ethereum. 
</p>
<p>
How can the traditional business (real estate, in this paper) benefit from these new coordination concepts, tools and solutions? What is the distinct value in Web3? That’s what we’ll explore in this paper. And no, we’ll not talk about tokenizing real estate.
